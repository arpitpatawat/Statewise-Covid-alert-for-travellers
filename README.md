# Statewise-Covid-alert-for-travellers (Hardware + Simulation)
My proposed model for live tracking the COVID
data involves using the real time data as uploaded by
common and reliable website sources. I am
scraping the data of use, that involves counts such as
total cases of a particular state or active cases of a
particular state, etc. Then I pass this data to our
LCD using a Wi-Fi module of NodeMCU(ESP8266)
and display it to our users.
The alert system works on a simple if and else
condition. Similar to a tracking system, I parse in
the active number of active cases, of a particular
state, as our conditional statement. I am also fixing a
threshold value that acts as an indicator to our alert
system and if the threshold limit is breached by the
active number of cases, I activate the alert
systems.The social distance detector uses an ultrasonic
distance sensor to find the range of another being
within 6-feet and it comes with an added buzzer that
turns on when the distance is less than 6-feet.

**A.	Live Data Tracker:**
- a.	The live count is fetched from Zee newsâ€™ official website.
- b.	The Scrapped data is auto-updated in ThingSpeack Cloud.
- c.	The Arduino is coded in an online editor and then is burned with our NodeMCU.
- d.	The LCD is connected with our NodeMCU to display our live data.


**B.	E-mail Alert System:**
- a.	The electronic mail system employs coding in MATLAB.
- b.	The implementation is done using conditional branching in MATLAB.
- c.	The number of active cases is considered and based on it an alert is sent to the fed email address of user.


**C.	Social Distance Detector:**
- a.	The software simulation of social distance detector is demonstrated using Tinkercad.
- b.	It uses ultraviolet sensors that detect the distance if a particular object enters its range.
- c.	It is added with a buzzer which starts when the range is less than the specified limit.
